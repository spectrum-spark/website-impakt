::: {#about-block}    

Professor Ivo Mueller is a malaria epidemiologist, who is the Co-Division Head of the Population Health and Immunity Division at the WEHI. His research centres on field-based studies of host-vector-parasite interactions, burden and transmission of different Plasmodium species, the treatment and prevention of malaria as well as in-depth studies of natural acquisition of immunity, host genetic modification of malaria risk and the effect of parasite diversity on the host response to malarial infections. A special focus of his work is on the biology, treatment, control and elimination of P. vivax malaria.
 
 More recently his laboratory has leveraged their experience from malaria serology to develop novel approaches to COVID-19 sero-surveillance and are studying the acquisition and maintenance of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In parallel, they are supporting health authorities in the Pacific with planning for and managing the COVID-19 pandemic by modelling different SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenarios and development of analytical tools to monitor the local progression of the pandemic.
