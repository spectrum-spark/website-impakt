The consortium includes collaborations from globally recognized public health institutions in Australia and the Asia Pacific region. The program areas focus on public health workforce development and strengthening outbreak detection and management systems and processes, to ultimately increase regional capacity using quantitative methods and modelling.\nBased at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne (UoM) in Melbourne, Australia, the SPARK consortium includes:\nNossal Institute for Global Health Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) Australian National University (ANU) CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisations) Mahidol University, Thailand Pasteur Institute, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam The Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, Indonesia\nSPARK is an acronym for Strengthening Preparedness in the Asia-Pacific Region through Knowledge, and builds on the PRISM2 CRE.\nAlthough SPARK is based in Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, our partners and collaborators work globally, with a central focus on Australia and the Asia-Pacific region."

A special focus of his work is on the biology, treatment, control and elimination of P. vivax malaria.\nMore recently his laboratory has leveraged their experience from malaria serology to develop novel approaches to COVID-19 sero-surveillance and are studying the acquisition and maintenance of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infections. In parallel, they are supporting health authorities in the Pacific with planning for and managing the COVID-19 pandemic by modelling different SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenarios and development of analytical tools to monitor the local progression of the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Projects\n\n\nRelated publications\n\nFadilah, I., Djaafara, B.A., Lestari, K.D., Fajariyani, S.B., Sunandar, E., Makamur, B.G., Wopari, B., Mabui, S., Ekawati, L.L., Sagara, R. and Lina, R.N., 2022.

She has extensive expertise in clinical vaccine trials, epidemiologic studies and mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, gained at the University of Oxford, Health Protection Agency London and University of Melbourne.\nJodie is currently Professor and Director of Doherty Epidemiology at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. Her research group uses a range of biostatistical and epidemiological methods including modelling to synthesise insights gained from basic biology, epidemiological data and sociological research. These outputs advance understanding of the observed epidemiology of infectious diseases and inform predictions of the likely success of interventions to limit transmission and burden in different populations.\nFor the past 18 years she has been building capacity in infectious diseases modelling in Australia and the Asia Pacific Region to support immunization and pandemic preparedness strategies. She has led nationally distributed networks of modellers informing responses to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic.
