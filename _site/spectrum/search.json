SPECTRUM aims to reduce this burden using sustainable, participatory and model-driven approaches.\nSPECTRUM CRE will:\n\nProduce needed evidence for infectious disease control using models and other quantitative tools.\nUndertake regional risk assessments for emerging diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.\nFrame a proportionate response in the Australian Health Management Pan for Pandemic Influence, including early impact assessment and strategic use of health system resources.\nPromote optimal scheduling of pertussis vaccines on the National Immunisation Program.\nPlan an effective response to the drug-resistant tuberculosis crisis in Daru, Papua New Guinea.\nIdentify latent tuberculosis treatment as the most effective measure of tuberculosis control, including in low-income, high incidence countries, leading to international (WHO) policy change."
