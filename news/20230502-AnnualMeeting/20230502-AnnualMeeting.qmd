Held in the backdrop of the RACV Cape Shanck, 100 researchers across the consortia
gathered together to talk about the latest in infectious diseases research, 
including pandemic preparedness, disease surveillance, research software and
disease modelling.

Monday saw the early and mid career academics gather for networking, career
advice, tips on project management, and some fun storytelling. The evening wrapped
up at _place_, where food and discussion flowed.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the remainder of the consortia gathered together, with
presentations from [seed funded projects](projects.html), 

The organising committee consisted of: Nefel Tellioglu, Laura Bannerman,
Johanna Monk and TK Le.
