# About
Professor Jodie McVernon is a physician with subspecialty qualifications in 
public health and vaccinology. She has extensive expertise in clinical vaccine
trials, epidemiologic studies and mathematical modelling of infectious
diseases, gained at the University of Oxford, Health Protection Agency London
and The University of Melbourne. Her work focuses on the application of a
range of cross-disciplinary methodological approaches including mathematical
and computational models, to synthesise insights from basic biology, 
epidemiological data and sociological research. These models advance
understanding of the observed epidemiology of infectious diseases and
inform understanding of optimal interventions for disease control. She is
Director of Epidemiology at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection 
and Immunity, a joint venture of the University of Melbourne and Royal 
Melbourne Hospital, and a National Health and Medical Research Council 
(NHMRC) Principal Research Fellow.
