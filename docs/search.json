SPECTRUM aims to reduce this burden using sustainable,\nparticipatory and model-driven approaches.\nSPECTRUM CRE will:\nProduce needed evidence for infectious disease control using models\nand other quantitative tools.\nUndertake regional risk assessments for emerging diseases like Ebola\nand COVID-19.\nFrame a proportionate response in the Australian Health Management\nPan for Pandemic Influence, including early impact assessment and\nstrategic use of health system resources.\nPromote optimal scheduling of pertussis vaccines on the National\nImmunisation Program.\nPlan an effective response to the drug-resistant tuberculosis crisis\nin Daru, Papua New Guinea.\nIdentify latent tuberculosis treatment as the most effective measure\nof tuberculosis control, including in low-income, high incidence\ncountries, leading to international (WHO) policy change.\nHOW WE WORK\nSPECTRUM CRE focuses on four key themes in infectious disease\nprevention and control:\nEndemic infections (scabies)\nEmerging infectious diseases (COVID-19, pandemic influenza)\nConstraining the emergence of and selection for Antimicrobial\nResistance (AMR - multidrug resistant tuberculosis)\nReducing the risk and burden of vector-borne diseases (malaria)\nThis will be achieved using The Structured Decision-Making\nFramework:\n\n\n\n\n",
