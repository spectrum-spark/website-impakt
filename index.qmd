## WHAT WE DO
SPECTRUM's vision is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases in Australia and our region.

There is a disproportionate burden of infectious diseases in impoverished areas, which persist because of weak health systems and infrastructure. SPECTRUM aims to reduce this burden using sustainable, participatory and model-driven approaches.

SPECTRUM CRE will:

* Produce needed evidence for infectious disease control using models and other quantitative tools.
* Undertake regional risk assessments for emerging diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.
* Frame a proportionate response in the Australian Health Management Pan for Pandemic Influence, including early impact assessment and strategic use of health system resources.
* Promote optimal scheduling of pertussis vaccines on the National Immunisation Program.
* Plan an effective response to the drug-resistant tuberculosis crisis in Daru, Papua New Guinea.
* Identify latent tuberculosis treatment as the most effective measure of tuberculosis control, including in low-income, high incidence countries, leading to international (WHO) policy change.

## HOW WE WORK
SPECTRUM CRE focuses on four key themes in infectious disease prevention and control:

* Endemic infections (scabies)
* Emerging infectious diseases (COVID-19, pandemic influenza)
* Constraining the emergence of and selection for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR - multidrug resistant tuberculosis)
* Reducing the risk and burden of vector-borne diseases (malaria)

This will be achieved using The Structured Decision-Making Framework:
